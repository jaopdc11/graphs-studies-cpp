# Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms

This folder contains algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees in graphs.

## Files

- `kruskal_minimum_spanning_tree.cpp` — Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm.
- `prim_minimum_spanning_tree.cpp` — Implementation of Prim's algorithm.

## Usage

To compile and run an example:

```bash
g++ kruskal_minimum_spanning_tree.cpp -o exec && ./exec
```

or

```bash
g++ prim_minimum_spanning_tree.cpp -o exec && ./exec
```

## Notes

- All code is written in modern C++ and is well-commented for educational purposes.
- For more details on each algorithm, see the comments at the top of each file.
