# Graph Algorithms in C++

This repository contains well-documented implementations of classic graph algorithms and representations, all written in modern C++. The goal is to provide a clear, didactic reference for studying and practicing graph theory and algorithms.

## 📂 Structure

- `representations/`  
  Graph representations such as adjacency list and adjacency matrix.

- `search_algorithms/`  
  Traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).

- `shortest_path_algorithms/`  
  Algorithms for finding shortest paths, such as Dijkstra's algorithm.

- `minimum_spanning_tree/`  
  Algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees, such as Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms.

- `utils/`  
  Utility files, such as random graph generators.

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

To compile any file, use:

```bash
g++ path/to/file.cpp -o exec && ./exec
```
