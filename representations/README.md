# Graph Representations

This folder contains different ways to represent graphs in C++.

## Files

- `graph_adjacency_list.cpp` — Graph representation using adjacency lists.
- `graph_adjacency_matrix.cpp` — Graph representation using adjacency matrices.

## Usage

To compile and run an example:

```bash
g++ graph_adjacency_list.cpp -o exec && ./exec
```

or

```bash
g++ graph_adjacency_matrix.cpp -o exec && ./exec
```

## Notes

- All code is written in modern C++ and is well-commented for educational purposes.
- For more details on each representation, see the comments at the top of each file.
